    <!-- Question 3 -->
	<p>My name is Carter Pehr, and I am currently a Freshman in the college of Natural Resources.
	I am, however, more interested in Mechanical Engineering and hope to CODA into that program in the fall.
	This process has been described as rigorous, but I believe that I have what it takes!
	I wish to graduate in four years like most, and then continue on to graduate school.
	</p>
	<br />
    <p>I have had a couple jobs in the past, both as a lifeguard and a party host at a trampoline park.
    The former was a very enjoyable job, as I mostly got paid to get tan and practice diving.
    Only a few saves were made over my four years as a lifeguard, which I'm grateful for.
    Working at the trampoline park was a lot more work, but it taught me valuable leadership skills.
    My dream job would have to be working at Tesla, because I love everything going on over there and could put my engineering to good use.
    </p>
